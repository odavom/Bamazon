# Bamazon

This a a CLI based amazon-like store with two user interfaces: customers & managers.

# CUSTOMER
User types  -- node bamazonCustomer -- in the command line. They are then shown an inventory of items. Users can order items by entering the item id number and then quantity. They are then shown the total price of their purchase.
If the quantity is more then what is in stock,the request is denied and the user is asked if they'd like to order anything else.

# MANAGER
User types -- node bamazonManager -- in the command line. The user is then presented with a list of options: 
- view products
- low inventory
- add inventory
- add product
The user should start by viewing products so as to have the item id numbers. The pictures below will illustrate.
